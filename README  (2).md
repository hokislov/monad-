## 1. Fork this Repo & give star
## 2. Login with Gitpod.io

## 3. Install Dependency 

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

```

## 5. Monad Template
```
forge init --template monad-developers/foundry-monad zotac
```
```
cd zotac
```

### 6. Modify Foundry configuration
Update foundry.toml file to add Monad configuration.

```
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]

# Monad Configuration

eth-rpc-url = "https://rpc-devnet.monadinfra.com/rpc/3fe540e310bbb6ef0b9f16cd23073b0a"

chain_id = 20143

# Etherscan Configuration
[etherscan]

monadDevnet = { key = "DUMMY_VALUE", url = "https://explorer.monad-devnet.devnet101.com/", chain = 20143 }

```
### 7. Write a smart contract
You can write your smart different contracts under the src folder. There is already a Counter contract in the project located at src/Counter.sol.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }
}
```

### 8. Compile the smart contract

```
forge compile
```

### 9. Deploy the smart contract
Use the below command to deploy a smart contract by directly pasting the private key in the terminal.

```
forge create --private-key <your_private_key> src/Counter.sol:Counter --broadcast

```
On successful deployment of smart contract, the output should be similar to the following:

```
Deployer: 0xB1aB62fdFC104512F594fCa0EF6ddd93FcEAF67b
Deployed to: 0x67329e4dc233512f06c16cF362EC3D44Cdc800e0
Transaction hash: 0xa0a40c299170c9077d321a93ec20c71e91b8aff54dd9fa33f08d6b61f8953ee0
```

### 10. Verify a smart contract on Monad
Use the below command to verify a smart contract by replacing contract address in the terminal.

```
forge verify-contract \
  --rpc-url https://explorer.monad-devnet.devnet101.com/api/eth-rpc \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url 'https://explorer.monad-devnet.devnet101.com/api/' \
  0x67329e4dc233512f06c16cF362EC3D44Cdc800e0 \
  src/Counter.sol:Counter
```
On successful verification of smart contract, you should get a similar output in your terminal:
```
Start verifying contract `0x1355a4f7829161a4d27BDb8970D32b89ef89A1Be`
Submitting verification for [src/Counter.sol:Counter] 0x1355a4f7829161a4d27BDb8970D32b89ef89A1Be.
Submitted contract for verification:
    Response: `OK`
    GUID: `1355a4f7829161a4d27bdb8970d32b89ef89a1be67448d78`
```

Now all done.. star the repo...
